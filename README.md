# iPadEnrollmentPowerApp
Power App for assigning a DEP Device 

iPadIntuneConnector.swagger.json needs '{depOnboardingSettingId}' replaced (lines 16, 266, 343) with your Enrollment Program Token ID. 

Connection to Custom Connector will need DeviceManagementServiceConfig.ReadWrite.All permissions. 

These are files exported from Power Apps. I've never had to import them so I don't know the process of that. If you import this into your environment, I'd love some input on that process and if there is anything I can do to make it better. I'd also love to hear your input overall and what features would be beneficial.
